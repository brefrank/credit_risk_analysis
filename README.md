# Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview

This analysis was created to model different resampling options in order to best predict credit risk. Imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries were used to test oversampling, undersampling, and a combination of the two. Two machine learning models used to reduce risk, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, were also ran before evaluating results. 

## Results

There is a bulleted list that describes the balanced accuracy score and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models

## Summary

There is a summary of the results
There is a recommendation on which model to use, or there is no recommendation with a justification
